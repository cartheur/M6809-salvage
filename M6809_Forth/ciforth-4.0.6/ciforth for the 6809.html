<h2>ciforth for 6809 </h2>
<hr><a name="6"></a><p>
</p><h2> ci6809 : a 6809 Forth</h2>
The Forth for
the Motorola 6809
is based on the
<a href="https://home.hccnet.nl/a.w.m.van.der.horst/lina.html">4.0.0 release of lina Forth for Intel Linux</a>
It is intended for a single board computer,
and so it is only a
<a href="https://home.hccnet.nl/a.w.m.van.der.horst/ci6809-1.0.tar.gz">source distribution,</a>
with sample configurations for ROM and RAM versions.
<a it="" contains="" no="" operating="" system="" interface.="" the="" block="" are="" present,="" but="" example="" configurations="" have="" them="" not="" configured.="" this="" 16-bit="" iso="" forth="" for="" motorola="" 6809="" had="" need="" a="" name,="" because="" cannot="" be="" invoked="" from="" an="" operation="" system.="" generic="" i="" dubbed="" ci6809.="" <br="">
In <i>fig/eForth</i> tradition it is based on an assembler in
only one file.
This standalone version require you to think about ROM and RAM,
and provide your own serial routines.
If you have found a way to provide mass storage you can
configure the block words in, that have not been removed.
This is not a binary download, but a generic system.
If you configure the system to meet your needs,
a push on the button generates fitting
documentation ready to  be viewed or printed.
This release 1.0 is based on version 4.0.0 of lina,
later releases will retrofit some improvements.
<p>
It is a stable release. The version represented by <b>ram.cfg</b> and
<b>rom.cfg</b> have been built and have been tested on a Brutech 6809
board (B.E.M. SBC3X), using the built in regression test and the John
Hopkins test suite, which revealed no defects.

It can be modified and rebuild from the above assembler source,
by the </a><a href="https://home.hccnet.nl/a.w.m.van.der.horst/m6809.html"> Motorola standard assembler</a>. </li>
</ul>
There is a chapter about the Forth 6809 assembler in the manual
of <a href="https://home.hccnet.nl/a.w.m.van.der.horst/lina.html">lina</a>.
The whole documentation of this assembler (including 32-bits Intel)
is present in the 6809 documentation.
The 6809 assembler is part of the assembler package,
a <a href="https://home.hccnet.nl/a.w.m.van.der.horst/forthassembler.html">generic assembler with plug ins.</a>
So it can be run on other ciforth<b>'s.
<hr><p>
There is no list of current defects.
See also the list of <a href="https://home.hccnet.nl/a.w.m.van.der.horst/ciforthdefects.html">defects of the ciforth
in general. </a> .
Be warned that some of these defects do not apply to a stand alone
version.
This release undoubtedly contains defects of its own.
This Forth is marginally usable interactively,
because looking up words in the dictionary is slow.
