( GOING FORTH DOCUMENTATION )                                        This Software package has been put together to allow       a beginning FORTH programmer to come up to speed on the         FORTH programming approach in the most efficient manner.        It contains a comprehensive Computer Aided Instruction          Course, a general HELP utility, and sample programs.               Care has been taken to avoid any hardware dependancies       which would complicate transportability between systems         which conform to the FORTH Intrest Group Common Model. In order to fit onto one 5 1/4 inch diskette it has been trimmed slightlyby deleting the FIG EDITOR.  It presumes that the user has the  FIG EDITOR already loaded, and it switches to that vocabulary   by simply the word 'EDITOR' when it is needed.
