This is CMOC 0.1.65 packaged for Windows

It was built using MinGW on Ubuntu 16.04.

Additionally "cpp" and its dependencies
 cpp.exe
 libwinpthread-1.dll
 cc1plus.exe
 libgmp-10.dll
 zlib1.dll
were copied from a "git-sdk" MinGW runtime.

lwasm.exe and lwlink.exe were copied from my zip files
at the LWTOOLS home page (contrib).

To use it, unpack the zip somewhere, and add the "cmoc-win32" folder to your path.
